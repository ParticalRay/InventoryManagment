# InventoryManagement
Inventory Management Application created for class

The application will load an interface to create part and product objects 
manage them. A product can have multiple parts and is linked to those parts. 
The product window will allow the ability to add multiple parts to the 
product using a table. The parts can be selected and used to be included in the 
creation of the product. 

Parts and products will include a modify window that can be used to alter the 
information on each object on the fly. There will be a warning on the deletion
of a part if it is associated with a current product.
